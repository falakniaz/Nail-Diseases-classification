## 📖 About this Research

> This study presents an AI-based approach for the automated classification of nail conditions using deep learning. A dataset consisting of 280 nail images across four classes, normal, hyperpigmentation, clubbing, and fungal infection was utilized. To ensure reliable evaluation, the dataset was split at the original image level prior to training, and data augmentation was applied exclusively to the training set. Six transfer learning models were evaluated under a unified experimental protocol, including VGG16, ResNet50, DenseNet201, InceptionV3, Vision Transformer, and MobileNetV3. Experimental results demonstrate that MobileNetV3 achieved the highest performance on an independent test set, attaining up to 99\% accuracy while maintaining a lightweight architecture. These findings highlight the effectiveness of MobileNetV3 for image-based nail condition classification under limited data constraints and suggest its potential suitability for resource-efficient, screening-oriented applications. The proposed system is intended as a decision-support tool rather than a diagnostic replacement.
